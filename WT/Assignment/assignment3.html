	An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the <span id="one"></span>. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.
</p>
<p>
	The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his <span id="two"></span> became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.
</p>
<p>
	He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:“An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, <span id="third"></span>, and even his face is freshened up.” The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked: Villager: What happened to you? “Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.” – An Old Man
